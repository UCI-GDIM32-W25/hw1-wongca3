# HW1

## W1L2 In-Class Activity
HW1 Breakdown:

How would you describe this game world in objects?
- Player, Seeds, Seeds UI

What attributes and actions do these objects have?
- Player- sprite
  - movement (WASD), planting (Space)
- Plants- sprite
  - prefab (quant: 5)
  - cannot move
  - appears upon pressing space
- Seeds Planted UI- increased based on number of times space is pressed
- Seeds Left UI- decreases based on number of times space is pressed

How do these objects act on or affect each other ?
- Player sprite changes position based on player input keys,
- Seeds appear based on the playerâ€™s position and pressing space,
- UI changes based on number of times player plants using space

## Devlog
Devlog: HW1 was a helpful review of the topics we studied in GDIM31 last quarter. The in-class breakdown we wrote for this assignment dissected the game world into objects, attributes, and actions. I started in player class as it is first on the breakdown list. To enable player movement, I wrote code to get WASD key inputs from the player to transform the sprite's position. I included this in the Update function because the player movement is an action that should be tracked every frame of the game. I worked on the PlantSeed method in the player class so that it could instantiate according to the player sprite's position. In PlantSeed, I wrote code to adjust the number of seeds planted/left when a new prefab is spawned and also call the UpdateSeeds method to update the UI accordingly. Back in the Update function, I called the finished PlantSeed method when space is pressed. The breakdown includes plants as limited to 5, so I wrote an if statement for PlantSeed to be called only when there are seeds available. For the UI part of the breakdown, TextMeshPro is used in the code and scene to display the plants planted and left based on the game state.

Although the code and breakdown I wrote was very similar, one difference is that the breakdown lists the UI increasing/decreasing based on inputting space. This feature was not written in the UI class but rather the Player class PlantSeed method. It proceeds the instantiation of the plant prefab rather than being written with GetKey. The breakdown was a good skeleton for the assignment, but not an exact one-to-one.

## Prof comments
Thank you for describing the connection between the breakdown and your code clearly- this Devlog will recieve full marks. :)

> The breakdown was a good skeleton for the assignment, but not an exact one-to-one.

I'm glad you found it useful- and it's totally normal for the implementation that you end up doing to be a little different from the plan you wrote. Hopefully that means you learned something useful while coding. Also, the planning stage is there to help you think through how you're going to structure your project before you get bogged down in the details of coding. I'm looking forward to hearing about whether or not you find the HW2 break-down to be helpful in your next Devlog!

Please consider formatting your break-down activities with the hyphen '-' symbol as suggested above, and make sure the activity and Devlog are in the correct sections. Also, you can remove the prompt text. This will make it a lot easier for me to read. See the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
